        <p> Singapore is a small city-state located in South-East Asia which borders Malaysia. The country is officially
          just 56 years old (!!!) which is likely younger than some of you reading this blog. The country first 
          became an area of international interest after it established itself as the world's largest publically
          owned shipping port. This allowed for a constant influx of new people from different backgrounds to enter the 
          country and leave their mark on its culture. This is partially why the population is so diverse and unique 
          in its makeup. The Singaporean government also enacted the 'Speak Good English' movement in 2000 to promote 
          the adoption of English as the country's main language in order to increase tourism. The movement was a huge 
          social and cultural success and likely played a large role in bringing you to this blog. <p>

                <p>Singapore is also known as the 'Garden city' due to how green and natural it is. Creations like the cloud 
                  dome have helped foster and mantain this image that attracts millions of visitors every year. <p>

        <p>Welcome to my travel guide! My name is Tarush Nandrajog. I am currently a sophmore at the University 
           of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but I have lived in Singapore for just under 10 years over 2 different stints
           and so I know all of the ins and outs of the country. As you can see from the baby photo, I am a big fan
           of cricket, as well as football and basketball. In highschool my friends and I also spent a lot of time 
           at many of the beaches in Singapore, with my personal favourite being Tanjong Beach. Enjoy the sunset photo
           displayed from the last time I went.</p>

    travel destination for you! <p>
