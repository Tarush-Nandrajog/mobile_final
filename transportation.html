        <main>
    
            <p>There are several different ways of traveling around Singapore as a tourist.
                Singapore's many green initiatives have aimed to reduce the number of private
                cars on the road by investing heavily to improve several other forms of public
                and private transportation. All of these methods of transportation are readily
                available for tourists to use. As a Singaporean local, I would highly recommend
                using the public transportation system as much as possible. It is a great way to
                get a feel for the city, interact with locals, and maybe even make a new friend!<p>

                            <div class = "flex_text">
                                <p> Biking has long been one of the most fun and healthy ways for people to get around the city. Given how
                                    compact the city is and how accessible many of the popular tourist destinations are, you can bike almost
                                    anywhere! This photo was taken in a bike path in East Coast Park which is a short ride  from the sea and a
                                    gorgeous place to explore You can opt to rent a bike from stores along the park or use a public bike rental
                                    app like Spin which is also present here in the US. <p>

                                <p> The Bus system in Singapore is one-of-a-kind given how clean, safe, and affordable it is. Downloading the bus
                                    app from the app store will help you navigate the different bus routes with ease and get you to any part of
                                    the city in timely fashion. The buses are also disability friendly and passengers with the need for any special
                                    accommodations should feel comfortable asking the bus driver for help. <p>

                            <div class = "flex_text">
                                <p> The MRT system in Singapore is truly one of a kind!. With both above and underground lines, it is one of the
                                    fastest ways of zipping around the city. <p>

                                <p> Finally you have the private taxi system. Taxis in Singapore are far more affordable than those in the US and
                                    therefore are a viable option for people in a more widespread income group. Black and yellow taxis like this one
                                    are slowly dying out and so you are more likely to hail or book a blue 'comfort delgro' cab. <p>
