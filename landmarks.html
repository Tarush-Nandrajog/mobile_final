            <p>Singapore was recently voted the most instagramable city in the world (!!!) and much
                of that honour can be attributed to the endless number of famous landmarks that it
                has to offer. Some of its landmarks like the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands hotel
                are amongst the most recognisable monuments in the world. As one of Asia's cultural 
                hubs, Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures and tradtions which is well
                reflected in its landmarks. Along with this there are many hidden gems like Haji lane
                and the Asian Civilizations Museum that this guide will briefly touch on to make sure 
                you are getting the full Singaporean experience on your trip. Many of these landmarks
                can be visited on the same day and for free so try and check out as many as you can! <p>
